## Final-project-group-work
### Our main division of labor is as follows:
#### Yining Sun:
In version1, locate the points where branches and apples are generated. In version2, create the graded generation of branches and the random generation of fruits. Organize and fine-tune the final code.
#### Ruoqian Xiong:
Responsible for the background, including setting the sky's base color and adding texture and depth to the entire background using a large number of randomly generated noisy rectangles.
#### Dingyang Gao: 
Draw base area visuals: first dark green ground strips and yellow main base, then loop with color array to create six colored blocks, next draw decorative arcs of varying colors and radii below and between blocks, finally scatter semi-transparent white dots for noise texture.
#### Tian Gan:
Responsible for the apple system, including generating apples with random positions and color changes at different branch levels, and realizing the complete apple animation process - from slightly swinging on the tree, falling under the influence of gravity, to the state transition of the final landing.
#### Nuo Zhang:
Responsible for the branch system. In version 1, recreated the tree branches based on the original artwork with slight sway animation. In version 2, redesigned the system to generate branches procedurally, adding multiple levels and random splitting so the tree forms new structures each time it runs.

### Our group's cooperation form: 
Discussing the production together through online and offline meetings.
